            <h1>Who is Kate Chopin?</h1>
            <div class="p-container">
            <p id="chopin-paragraph">
              Kate Chopin was an American novelist and short-story writer best known for her startling 
              1899 novel, The Awakening. Born in St. Louis, she moved to New Orleans after marrying Oscar 
              Chopin in 1870. Less than a decade later Oscar's cotton business fell on hard times and 
              they moved to his family's plantation in the Natchitoches Parish of northwestern Louisiana. 
              Oscar died in 1882 and Kate was suddenly a young widow with six children. She turned to 
              writing and published her first poem in 1889. The Awakening, considered Chopin's 
              masterpiece, was subject to harsh criticism at the time for its frank approach to sexual 
              themes. It was rediscovered in the 1960s and has since become a standard of American 
              literature, appreciated for its sophistication and artistry. Chopin's short stories of 
              Cajun and Creole life are collected in Bayou Folk (1894) and A Night in Acadie (1897), 
              and include "Desiree's Baby," "The Story of an Hour" and "The Storm."

                <p>
                  "Désirée's Baby" is an 1893 short story by the American writer Kate Chopin. It is about miscegenation in Creole Louisiana

                <p>
                  The twenty-one short stories in A Night in Acadie, like those of Bayou Folk, take place in the uniquely blended, 
                  multicultural Louisiana. Yet unlike Chopin's first collection of short stories, A Night in Acadie reveals a bolder, 
                  less traditional treatment of bayou life.

                  "Bayou Folk" by Kate Chopin is a collection of stories written about those who called the Bayou of Louisiana home. 
                  The book is full of the spirit and customs of the Creoles and Acadians. Though these populations have long disappeared, 
                  having their stories committed to text ensures that they won't be forgotten.

              Her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair. They were thick and almost horizontal, emphasizing the depth 
              of her eyes. She was rather handsome than beautiful. Her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness 
              of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features. Her manner was engaging.
            </p>

            <p>
              It wasn't that he hated her. It was simply that he didn't like her much.It was difficult for him to explain 
              this to her, and even more difficult for her to truly understand. She was in love and wanted him to feel the 
              same way. He didn't, and no matter how he tried to explain to her she refused to listen or to understand.

              The headache wouldn't go away. She's taken medicine but even that didn't help. The monstrous throbbing in
               her head continued. She had this happen to her only once before in her life and she realized that only one 
               thing could be happening.
